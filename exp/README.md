Experimental code for groja.com .

### Versions

See the index.html file for a list of the versions we experimented with.

Each entry in the list includes a link to and description of the version.

### Abandoned AMP early on

We abandoned the amphtml5 version fairly early on, it is quite restrictive in its demands.

For example, the instructions say that all css must be in the header.  
I could not find clarification as to whether this meant the links must be there, or the css itself must be inline in the html file, and did not feel like playing around with it.

Also, it uses these amp-* tags.  Sorry but having been burned by obsolencence before, I am reluctant to have my site dependent on something that is still version 0.1.

### Abandoning the other versions

Playing around with the other versions, refining content goals etc., after a few days it became obvious that the initializr-bootstrap version was a good match.

This was, for the most part, an aesthetic decision, based on the coolness of the jumbotron and collapsible "hamburger menu icon" menu.

Also, keeping the various versions up-to-date quickly proved to be a pain, so once that effort ceased to have value, I was happy to give it up.

### Note to self:

Trying to copy selected css from one boilerplate example to another turned out to be a huge waste of time.
