    <h3>One Day in Art History Class...</h3>
    <p>
      One day in a History of Modern Painting (Art History) class at VCU
      the teacher introduced us to Piet Mondrian...</p>
    <p>
      As someone who was interested in Artificial Intelligence at the time,
      the thought <span class="air-quotes">a computer could do that!</span>
      jumped into my head.</p>
    <p>
      The teacher tried to impress upon us how difficult it is to produce 
      something like this.</p>
    <p>
      As someone who grew up with a lot of negativity, I always had some interest in
      psychology &mdash; in learning why we think the things we do.
      Early on I discovered Myers-Briggs' and Keirsey's work, and
      eventually found time to read Carl Jung's original work.
    <p>
      Trying to think of how to write a program to <span class="air-quotes">do that</span>
      was definitely a challenge.</p>
    <p>
      Reading Mondrian's writings increased my admiration for the man
      It is amazing &mdash; but not entirely surprising &mdash; to learn that he lived
      much of his life in poverty.</p>

    <h3>Manifesto: A Statement of Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Does this seem complicated?</p>
    <p>
      Is it at all obvious that this idea's roots are in abstract paintings done close to a hundred years ago?
      I hope not, but if it does, let's clear something up right now.</p>
    <p>
      At its core, the purpose of this idea is two-fold:</p>
    <ul class="standalone">
      <li>
        To enable us to see the invisible</li>
      <li>
        To promote harmony between opposites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See, it's really not that complicated after all!</p>

      List of versions:</p>
    <dl class="standalone">
      <dt>
        Grad School IBM 8086 PC version</dt>
      <dd>
        Written in LISP for my Interdisciplinary Masters Degree.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Raw PHP 4 version</dt>
      <dd>
        Not Object Oriented and a hellish interface, but it drew images (until the register globals thing).
        </dd>
      <dt>
        PHP Nuke version</dt>
      <dd>
        The best thing I can say about PHP Nuke is, it made me willing to try out Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Joomla 1.x version</dt>
      <dd>
        An attempt to create a social, web 2.0, rolling-blog type of site.
        I am not the type to monitor or even promote this type of site.
        Now the software but even the basic goals and paradigm of the site is totally obsolete.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Next version?!?</dt>
      <dd>
        Now that there are so many new technologies, and they are all changing so fast,
        it is difficult to prioritize on how to build on this idea.
        That is why I am making this personal: talking to users and creating individualized and personal portraits.
        This will fuel how I decide to continue with this work.
