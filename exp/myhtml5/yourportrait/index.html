    <h3>Your Portrait</h3>
    <p>
      Due to a large variety of reasons, the biggest one being I want total control over the quality of these images,
      I have decided to create all Spiritual Portraits by hand.</p>
    <p>
      Although a large part of this process is automated by the Groja Program &copy;,
      producing high-quality, unique and personalized portraits, and
      ensuring you understand its significance and meaning requires a personal touch.</p>
    <p>
      Finally, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
      orientations (portrait vs. landscape) not currently demonstrated in the
      <a href="../galleries/gallery.html" title="Link to the galleries page">
        galleries</a>.
      I can help you decide what sort of image pleases you and
      ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>

  <section id="cost">
    <h3>How Much?</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of each Spiritual Portrait ranges from $0 to $500 and
      depends on how much <span class="air-quotes">work</span> I have to put into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know your four-letter type, the corresponding
      <a href="../galleries/gallery.html?gallery=generics" title="Link to the generic portraits' galleries page">
        generic portrait</a>
      is an image of your personality.

    <h3>Factors Affecting the Cost</h3>
    <p>
      Following is a list of factors affecting the cost of your personalized Spiritual Portrait:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Which version of the quiz you take
        </li>
      <li>
        How much time I have to spend explaining the process to you
        </li>
      <li>
        How much time I spend explaining the underlying theory, and its significance in our day-to-day lives, to you
        </li>
      <li>x
        </li>
      <li>x
        </li>
      <li>x
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I have absolutely no expectation that creating these will make me fabulously rich,
      and I am certainly not looking to take advantage of anyone here.
      </p>
    <p>
      However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
      writing the
      <a href="../about/#versions" title="Link to the list of versions on the 'About' page">
        various versions</a>
      of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
      ultimately the (highly unnatural &mdash; for me, anyway) effort required to
      let people know that this service is available.</p>
    <p>
      And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
      making sure it meets your satisfaction.
      </p>
    <p>
      So I hope that if you are interested, you will
      <a href="http://www.tomwhartung.com/contact-me/" target="_blank"

        contact me</a>
      and give me the opportunity to create a beautiful, unique, and
      highly personal Spiritual Portrait &mdash; one that you can fully appreciate and enjoy now and for years to come!
